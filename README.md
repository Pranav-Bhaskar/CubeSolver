# CubeSolver
This is a python based program which uses a dictionary type bruteforce approch to find the shortest solution of a cube.

# NOTE
Because of the size restriction's by github the final.combi file is bellow 100MB. But I have a bigger file which will help you with the speed problem. The link will be here soon.
